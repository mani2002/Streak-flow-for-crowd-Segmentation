# Streak-flow-for-crowd-Segmentation
Streak flow for crowd segmentation is an approach to segmenting dense crowds in images or videos using a combination of motion estimation and object segmentation. The idea behind streak flow is to track the motion of individual pixels over time and use this information to group pixels that belong to the same object.
