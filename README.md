# Streak flow for crowd Segmentation
Streak flow for crowd segmentation is an approach to segmenting dense crowds in images or videos using a combination of motion estimation and object segmentation. The idea behind streak flow is to track the motion of individual pixels over time and use this information to group pixels that belong to the same object.

## Overview:
The "Streak flow for crowd Segmentation" project is an approach to segmenting dense crowds in images or videos using a combination of motion estimation and object segmentation. This project uses optical flow and streak lines to track the motion of individual pixels over time and group pixels that belong to the same object, improving the accuracy of crowd segmentation.
